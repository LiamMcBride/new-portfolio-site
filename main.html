          <h1>My experience in the industry</h1>
          <p>
            Consists of my 9 month internship with the <b class="highlight-text">Exeleration Center</b>, where I consulted for <b class="highlight-text">Rhythm</b>. With Rhythm I helped the existing team further develop their customer support portal. This involved working with the Django backend and React frontend. I was able to gain valuable experience on both backend and frontend.
            <br>
            <br>
            My learning wasn't just about code though. I learned a lot about scrum and agile development, even completing a Certified Scrum Master course. Beyond that I grew in many other areas, like how to conduct myself on a developer team. How to interact successfully with project managers and QA testers. As well as how to seek out help effectively. Through the experience I spent about half of my developing time pair programming, which further added to my learning.

          <h1>I fell in love with code</h1>
          <p>Early on in freshman year of high school. I know it sounds cliche to “fall in love with code” but it's the truth! Coding isn’t just a job of mine, it’s a passion, an art form, and a way to express the ideas over-crowding my head. I quickly took to programming in my first class, doing small Visual Basic projects. After that I learned C# and Unity, which my passion of game design further propelled my interest in programming.

            Now why should anyone care about me loving code? Well if you're paying my page a social visit then you already have a great topic to talk to me about! But if you’re a company viewing this then my passion for code and developing has a few key benefits:
            Learning new languages + tools is an exciting challenge that I will jump at the chance to do.
            My endurance and dedication to solving a problem goes far beyond just wanting to do a good job. It is my passion to fix that problem.
            I’ll be excited to come to work and contribute to a project. A little more positive energy on a team is never a bad thing.
            I’ll be looking for ways to step up and contribute more to a project, whether that's through code or ideas.</p>

              This was a school project where you needed to create code that would use SHA to encrypt a password. The code then uses several password dictionaries to attempt and crack the code. The time to crack the password is recorded and displayed to the user.

              This was a simple game made using Unity. It's a copy of frogger except you're Myrtle trying not to get hit by Gatsby's car. This was made for an English project. It was a lot of fun to create the pixel assets.

              This was one of the first complete games I ever made. I made it for an English class assignment about the Salem Witch Trials. You can fly around as a witch and attack common-folk. I wouldn't say this is a representation of my current skill. I've come a long way since making this, but it's quite fun to show some of my earlier projects.
