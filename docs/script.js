This initiative served as a valuable exercise in project ideation and management for me. Our collective vision was to make a sophisticated show and movie ranking platform, uniquely centered on statistics, providing users with insightful recommendations based on personal preferences and those of their peers. My primary focus during this endeavor was on the design aspect of the project. I crafted diverse Figma flows, outlining the several user journeys through the platform. Simultaneously, my collaborator took charge of implementing our Flask backend, where I provided crucial assistance. We brought to life the user experience with a minimalist React interface that complemented our initial limited functionality. As the summer progressed, we successfully concluded the project. My collaborator gained invaluable coding skills, while I acquired extensive knowledge in UX design and Figma.",

During my research, I developed a Python project analyzing gray levels in a Perlin noise PNG, generating a text file with values based on pixel percentages. Subsequently, in Unity using C# I created a project that read this file, applied percentages to total height, and generated a world from the height-map, as depicted in the image. Witnessing the project come to life, especially with color-coded blocks based on height, was amazing. Despite its swift execution, the project produced relatively convincing landscapes, showcasing the effectiveness of Perlin noise in shaping diverse and captivating terrains in video games. As well as allowing me to give a well educated speech on the subject.",

I'm a big believer that 'soare' is the optimal word, but regardless I thought it would make an interesting challenge to solve a Wordle board. The original idea was to hook the bot up with Selenium and have it solve the real Wordle in the browser. But alas I never reached that point. Maybe one day. Essentially the bot creates scores based on where letters can and cannot be placed after the initial guess. From here it narrows down possible choices and makes more guesses. I've achieved on average a 60% success rate. Which is lower than my personal rate... so I would say it's far from a perfect program. But it had some exciting challenges and might be something I go back and optimize. Update: My friend made it as well in MatLab and had far more success so I definitely will be optimizing my solution, can’t let him get the better of me!",

        "description": "This was a simple game made using Unity. It's a copy of Frogger except you're Myrtle trying not to get hit by Gatsby's car. This was made for an English project. It was a lot of fun to create the pixel assets. And yes the cars don't have any collisions with each other. I like to think that adds to the charm. Made with Unity and Microsoft Paint.",

In addition, create functionality learned on your own. You must also use the CoreData database and two APIs. Our project uses a company information API as well as a job listing API. With these it creates an app for users to follow job postings and companies, receive updates and news about those companies and postings, create a resume with a modular template, and complete interview prep. In addition it’s secured using the FaceID interface. I specialized in designing the UI, creating interaction with the APIs, as well as displaying the Job and Company data correctly in the application.",

We were tasked with designing a user-friendly and engaging social technology platform. We decided to focus on reducing negative interactions on popular games made by Riot. To do this, we followed the four analysis phases of UX that we learned in class: contextual inquiry, contextual analysis, requirement extraction, and design-informing model construction. No code was written but a lot of value was obtained through the process, particularly the user studies where we walked testers through a user story and documented difficult interactions with our UI for improvement.",

Using React and Express, our chosen stack aligned seamlessly with our class experience. The app boasts a straightforward login, focusing solely on the player's name. Players can easily become hosts, gaining access to a view displaying buzz order, lobby participants, and unbuzzed players. The host can reset the buzzer, manage players, and even implement a profanity filter using the Obscenity package. Future plans include the option to add filtered names, along with an auto-generated QR code for simplified sharing on a localhost server. This project is really fun because we’ve actually used it several times since and it works really well for our use cases. It’s just a cool experience to use something you created with your friends.",
