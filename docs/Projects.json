The goal is to create a show ranking website, with social features, lots of statistics, and show recommendations. This is all to get more practice with actually working on production code. The main goal of this project is to launch a site and then to maintain the site as well as worry about security and storing user data and all of those extra tasks that are hard to come accross in regular solo projects.",
