          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate developer who loves making whatever I can with code.
            This includes websites, web apps, servers, video games, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I typically have one or two side projects going on at any one time and am always excited to chat about them!<br><br>
            Feel free to checkout some of my projects <a href="./projects.html">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h1>Experience</h1>
          <p>
            My first industry experience consists of my internship with the <a href="https://exelaration.com/" target="_blank">Exeleration Center</a> from September 2021 to August 2022, where I consulted for <a href="https://www.gotrhythm.com/" target="_blank">Rhythm</a>. With Rhythm I helped the existing team further develop their customer support portal. This involved working with the Django backend and React frontend. I was able to gain valuable experience on both backend and frontend.
            <br>
            <br>
            My learning wasn't just about code though. I learned a lot about scrum and agile development, even completing a Certified Scrum Master course. Beyond that I grew in many other areas, like how to conduct myself on a developer team. How to interact successfully with project managers and QA testers. As well as how to seek out help effectively. Through the experience I spent about half of my developing time pair programming, which further added to my learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            In May 2023 I joined the <a href="https://rosalab.github.io/" target="_blank">ROSA lab</a>, a Virginia Tech systems research group that focuses on eBPF.
            Here I had my first interaction with a modified kernel and systems work. For the research group I've been working to develop eBPF testing for my fellow researchers to test their eBPF programs quickly and effectively.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've learned so much while conducting research with them and it's been exciting to learn about kernel modifications and eBPF programs in detail. Especially since systems work isn't the field I'm expecting to go into, I've found great value in what I've been learning and know it will benefit me in the future. Whether I'm working on systems or not.

          <h1>Skills</h1>
          <p>
            I have experience with a variety of languages and tools, including:
            <ul>
              <li>C#: I've mainly used C# for making video games with Unity. Some of these are an fps zombie game, frogger clone, Minecraft clone, perlin noise map generator, a game jam side scroller, and a broom riding simulator.</li>
              <li>Python: I've used Python since 2018. I have made: servers in Flask and Django, utility scripts, applications utilizing APIs, GUI interfaces, chrome automations with Selenium, and database projects.</li>
              <li>Java: I've used Java since 2019 for various school projects. I've made large number arithmetic calculators, many data structures, a thread pool, and several other smaller school projects.</li>
              <li>JavaScript: </li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <!-- <p>

            One of the biggest things I bring to the table is my passion for code and developing, which has a few key benefits:
            <ul>
              <li>Learning new languages and tools is an exciting challenge that I will jump at the chance to do.</li>
              <li>My endurance and dedication to solving a problem goes far beyond just wanting to do a good job. It is my passion to fix that problem.</li>
              <li>I'll be looking for ways to step up and contribute more to a project, whether that's through code or ideas.</li>
              <li>I'll be excited to come to work and contribute to a project. A little more positive energy on a team is never a bad thing.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h1>In addition to all that</h1>
          <p>
            I want to learn more about project management, how to be a successful code architect, and UX design.<br><br>Recently I joined the Accessible Technologies Student Org (ATSO) at Virginia Tech and am helping to implement the club website. Through this process I am learning the fundementals of accessible design.
