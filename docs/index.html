          <h1>I'm a passionate developer</h1>
          <p>
            Who loves making whatever I can with code.<br>
            Not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Websites</li>
              <li>Video Games</li>

            I typically have one or two side projects going on at any one time. And am always excited to chat someone's ear off about them!<br><br>

          <h1>My experience in the industry</h1>
          <p>
            Consists of my 9 month internship with the <a href="https://exelaration.com/" target="_blank">Exeleration Center</a>, where I consulted for <a href="https://www.gotrhythm.com/" target="_blank">Rhythm</a>. With Rhythm I helped the existing team further develop their customer support portal. This involved working with the Django backend and React frontend. I was able to gain valuable experience on both backend and frontend.
            <br>
            <br>
            My learning wasn't just about code though. I learned a lot about scrum and agile development, even completing a Certified Scrum Master course. Beyond that I grew in many other areas, like how to conduct myself on a developer team. How to interact successfully with project managers and QA testers. As well as how to seek out help effectively. Through the experience I spent about half of my developing time pair programming, which further added to my learning.

          <h1>What I bring to the table</h1>
          <p>

            My passion for code and developing, which has a few key benefits:
            <ul>
              <li>Learning new languages and tools is an exciting challenge that I will jump at the chance to do.</li>
              <li>My endurance and dedication to solving a problem goes far beyond just wanting to do a good job. It is my passion to fix that problem.</li>
              <li>I'll be looking for ways to step up and contribute more to a project, whether that's through code or ideas.</li>
              <li>I'll be excited to come to work and contribute to a project. A little more positive energy on a team is never a bad thing.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h1>In addition to all that</h1>
          <p>
            I want to learn more about project management, how to be a successful code architect, and UX design.<br><br>Recently I joined the Accessible Technologies Student Org (ATSO) at Virginia Tech and am helping to implement the club website. Through this process I am learning the fundementals of accessible design.
